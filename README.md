# Color-Frenzy

I created Color Frenzy as a simple to play game that tests reaction time. It was the first game I created on IOS. It features a score, lives, and increases difficulty as the user advances.. In the future, I would like to make the game more aesthetically appealing by updating the UI. This project was used to explore game dynamics.
